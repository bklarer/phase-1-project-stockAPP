# CryptoApp
## About the Project
Originally this project was going to be designed for stocks but with the great availability of crypto APIs and resources, this was later changed to cryptocurrencies.

CryptoApp is a Single Page Application designed to search for cryptocurrencies and add them to a watchlist. On page load, the application automatically performs a fetch request to CoinGecko's API and displays the top ten Cryptos by market cap.

After the page is loaded, users are able to perform a search of any crypto that has a similar name or symbol related to the users input. Users can then add those cryptos to a watchlist and export it to a csv file.

## Goals
- Grab data from a server on cryptos
- Organize this data into search results
- Have a button to add these items to a watchlist
- Be able to delete items off of the watchlist
- Have the ability to export the data into a csv file

## Project Status
This project was designed to implement some of the skills at Flatiron School. Currently, I have no other plans for the project but may use what was learned from this project to build on later into a stock or crypto scanner with real time data.
